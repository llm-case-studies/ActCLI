# ActCLI — VC & Accelerator Fit (YC‑style Brief)
**Last updated:** 2025-09-18

**TL;DR:** Yes—credible fit for dev‑tool/AI‑infra investors and accelerators like YC **if** you tighten the wedge, make **trust/auditability** a product feature, and show bottoms‑up traction quickly.

---

## Why it fits the VC/YC pattern

1. **Non‑obvious wedge with “why now.”** CLI‑first, on‑prem AI for regulated actuarial workflows rides three waves: local LLMs, permissioned tool governance, and audit‑driven analytics.
2. **Bottoms‑up GTM.** “Just Python scripts” avoids long procurement and lets power users self‑adopt and evangelize.
3. **Straightforward monetization.** Open core + premium plugins + enterprise support + optional hosted components.
4. **Demo‑able MVP.** A single command from CSV → PDF report → audit pack fits YC’s bias for visible progress.

## Investor concerns to pre‑empt (and how)

- **TAM & “CLI is niche.”** Land with P&C reserving/pricing actuaries, then expand into risk analytics/capital modeling and adjacent regulated data‑science teams. Show the plugin architecture is general.
- **Reliability of AI in regulated settings.** Make *trust a feature*: dataset/code hashes, seeded runs, parameter/version ledger, and an auto‑generated evidence pack; LLMs assist only, computations remain deterministic.
- **Incumbents could add a CLI.** Win on speed + openness + governance: open plugin manifest, certification, and permissioned execution create an ecosystem moat, not just a feature.
- **Support burden.** Offer enterprise SLAs around the trust layer, certified connectors, and evidence‑pack templates.

## What to have before you apply/pitch (6–10 weeks)

1. **A killer 90‑second demo**

```bash
actcli reserve chainladder -i triangles.csv   --report out/report.pdf   --audit out/audit.json   --seed 42
```

Open both outputs on screen: the PDF report and the audit JSON + repro script.

2. **Design‑partner validation**  
   2–3 actuarial teams actively piloting (even unpaid), with weekly feedback calls. Capture quotes on *time‑to‑analysis* and *audit‑prep time*.

3. **Early usage telemetry (privacy‑safe)**  
   Counts of CLI runs, datasets processed, reports generated—no data content, just activity.

4. **Plugin governance as code**  
   Minimal `actplugin.toml`, `actcli plugin verify`, sandboxed permissions, and a signed example plugin.

5. **Monetization slide**  
   Free core; paid enterprise controls (RBAC/AD/LDAP/audit‑pack templates), certified connectors, optional hosted components. Keep pricing simple.

## YC‑style application one‑liners (paste‑ready)

- **What are you making?**  
  A CLI that lets actuaries run reserving, pricing, and Monte Carlo workflows with on‑prem LLM assistance—**auditable, reproducible, and scriptable**.

- **What’s new/why now?**  
  Local LLMs and permissioned tool access enable AI assistance without sending regulated data to the cloud; actuaries increasingly use Python/Git and want automation GUIs don’t offer.

- **Who needs this?**  
  P&C reserving/pricing actuaries in mid‑to‑large insurers, plus consulting firms that run repeatable, audit‑heavy analyses.

- **How do you make money?**  
  Open core; paid enterprise controls and certified plugins; professional support; later, a marketplace for third‑party modules.

- **Why won’t incumbents crush you?**  
  We win on speed, openness, and trust. The CLI ships reproducibility/audit as first‑class outputs and fosters a certified plugin ecosystem that closed GUIs can’t match quickly.

## Fundraising path options

- **Accelerator‑first (e.g., YC):** Optimize for a compelling demo and a visible slope of usage; leverage the network for design partners.
- **Pre‑seed with specialist VCs (devtools/AI/regtech):** Lead with the **compliance‑ready AI** angle and trust‑layer demo; bring 2–3 pilot logos/quotes.

Either path benefits from a **live repo**, a **90‑second demo video**, and **evidence‑pack outputs** that investors can open locally.

## 10‑slide pitch outline

1. Problem (audit‑heavy actuarial work stuck in spreadsheets/closed GUIs)  
2. Solution (CLI‑first + on‑prem AI + trust layer)  
3. Why now (local LLMs, MCP‑style tooling, data sovereignty)  
4. Product demo (CSV → PDF report + audit pack)  
5. Architecture (core CLI, plugins, sandbox, evidence pack)  
6. GTM (bottom‑up + design partners; “Just Python scripts”)  
7. Business model (open core + enterprise controls + certified connectors)  
8. Competition & moat (speed, openness, governance, ecosystem)  
9. Traction (pilots, usage telemetry, quotes)  
10. Team & roadmap (12‑week plan → enterprise features)

---

## Metrics to track from day 1

- Weekly active users and **commands executed**  
- Number of **reports/audit packs** generated  
- **Pilot feedback**: time‑to‑analysis, audit‑prep time, and error rate  
- **Plugin ecosystem**: verified plugins installed, permission prompts accepted/denied

---

## Recommendation

**Apply.** Walk in with a one‑command demo that proves **speed + safety**, and a story that your “CLI + trust layer + on‑prem LLMs” expands from actuaries to broader regulated analytics.
