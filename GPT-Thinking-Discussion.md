Short answer: yes—it’s doable. Most of what’s in the brainstorming report can be built on your current stack and aligns cleanly with the backlog in the whitepaper/addendum. A few items (multi‑AI “seminars,” junior‑model meta‑review) are stretch goals but still feasible if you ship them as thin slices after the core CLI + trust layer.

Below is a practical feasibility pass with “thin‑slice” build paths.

Feasibility at a glance
Idea from the brainstorming report	Value	Build complexity	Primary risks	Thin slice to ship first
Hybrid mode (cloud→local) with explicit switch + audit logging	High (trust + UX)	Low‑Med	Policy handling; UX clarity	Add --mode {offline,hybrid}; when --input is provided, force local LLM and log the hand‑off in audit.json (time, model, seed).
“Wizard” chat (actcli reserve --wizard) with a small local model	High (adoption)	Med	Prompt reliability; drift into “authoritative”	Keep LLM assistive‑only; emit suggested params/text and require confirm before compute. Log “LLM‑suggested; user‑approved.”
MCP‑style file handling in chat (permissioned read/write)	Med‑High	Med	Sandbox/permissions; traceability	Implement a minimal Plugin Manifest (actplugin.toml) + plugin verify and permission prompts for file ops; default no‑network.
Git/Gitea hooks for evidence packs	High (audit)	Low	Repo auth/paths	--host flag → auto‑commit report.pdf + audit.json with tag; mirrors the backlog’s Git hooks.
Multi‑AI “seminar” (actcli chat --multi claude,grok,llama)	Med (wow, peer‑review vibe)	Med‑High	Cost/latency; UX noise	Start with sequential compare: run the same prompt across N models → show diff + disagreement flags. Add live “round‑table” later.
“Junior” models that quiz/flag	Med	High (researchy)	False flags; added complexity	Begin with templated checklists (deterministic) + a small model that only asks clarifying questions; keep out of critical path.
Privacy for juniors (redaction, isolation, leak scans)	High (compliance)	Med	Over/under‑redaction	Start with static redaction rules + regex/allow‑list scans; log redactions in audit.json.
Telemetry (privacy‑safe counts)	High (traction proof)	Low	None if local only	Count commands/reports/audit packs; no payloads.
Monte Carlo & reserving core	High	Low‑Med	Performance on big triangles	Land the chain‑ladder path + seeded sims; this is already in your backlog.
Why I say “yes” (and where to be strict)

The hybrid switch + audit is a light routing layer + logging—you already planned evidence packs and Git hooks; this just formalizes the hand‑off (cloud ideation → local execution) and writes it to the audit trail, as your brainstorming doc proposes.

The wizard/chat keeps CLI adoption “comfy” without compromising controls. Your external critique stresses “assistive, not authoritative”—make that a policy baked into outputs and the audit record.

Plugin governance (manifest, sandbox, certification) was already in the addendum; MCP‑style file access simply rides that safety rail. Ship a minimal actcli plugin verify early.

The core backlog (commands, plugins, Git hooks) is already laid out on page 6: “Development Backlog and Specifications” of the whitepaper, and the business model on page 5 supports open‑core + paid governance features—smooth fit.

Concrete build slices (you can stack these)

Trust layer + core command (foundation)

actcli reserve chainladder -i triangles.csv --report out/report.pdf --audit out/audit.json --repro-script out/repro.sh --seed 42

audit.json fields: dataset hash, params, versions, seed, timestamps.

Unit tests with a golden dataset.
Matches whitepaper’s technical overview/backlog; becomes the demo spine.

Hybrid mode + audit of the hand‑off

--mode offline|hybrid.

On --input, force local model; append "handoff": {"from":"cloud","to":"local","t":"…","local_model":"…","seed":42} to audit.json.

Wizard chat (assistive‑only)

actcli reserve --wizard asks for data path, method, seed, and optional narrative.

Output shows suggestions + a one‑click confirm; the deterministic run happens after confirmation. Log "llm_suggestions": {..., "user_approved": true}.

Plugin manifest + verifier + sandbox

actplugin.toml with permissions = ["read:./data","write:./out","no-network"], semantic version, and signature.

actcli plugin verify enforces permissions and signature; default deny network. This operationalizes your addendum’s governance plan.

Compare‑N models (proto “seminar”)

actcli chat --compare llama,claude runs the same prompt across models → side‑by‑side text + disagreement flags.

Defer turn‑taking debates until you see value; start simple.

Redaction & leak checks (privacy for juniors)

Pre‑prompt filter that replaces marked fields with [REDACTED: ...].

Post‑response scan for leak patterns; log findings in audit.

Acceptance tests you can run locally

Determinism: two identical runs with --seed 42 produce byte‑identical audit.json and equal numeric results.

Hybrid safety: when --input is present in --mode hybrid, cloud calls stop and the handoff is present in audit.json.

Assistive‑only: the wizard never executes calculations without an explicit confirm; the audit shows "user_approved": true.

Governance: a plugin requesting network:* is rejected by plugin verify; a signed, minimal plugin passes.

Where this fits your docs

The brainstorming report adds hybrid mode, chat/wizard, multi‑AI seminars, juniors, and adoption tactics—these are incremental layers on top of your existing plan, not pivots.

The whitepaper already establishes the core MVP (commands, plugins, Git hooks) and a business model that monetizes the governance features you’ll now implement. See “Potential Business Model” (p. 5) and “Development Backlog and Specifications” (p. 6).

The additional considerations document is your blueprint for plugin certification, RBAC, and enterprise integration—exactly what the MCP/file‑ops and hybrid controls will lean on.

The external critique reinforces the “assistive, not authoritative” stance and the “Trojan‑horse” adoption path—bake those into policy and UI copy.

Bottom line

Doable: The plan is practical and incremental. Start with the deterministic CLI + trust layer, add the hybrid switch and wizard, then layer in plugin governance and simple model‑compare.

Disciplined scope: Treat multi‑AI debates and junior‑model quizzing as second‑wave enhancements once the core is stable and audited.

Investor‑ready narrative: This stays perfectly aligned with the story in your deck (CLI‑first + on‑prem LLMs + auditable workflows), with clear, demo‑able steps.

If you want, I can turn this feasibility grid into a one‑page checklist you can drop into the repo’s README so the team can start ticking boxes immediately.

You said:
Great! Thank you! Lets step back and reflect: what am I doing now? with all those attached docs etc - I am doing a manual version of "multi-AI seminar", right? That hints that this topic for me personally triggers a lot of curiosity and perceived value. I suspect that many actuarial folks or those with research background would feel the same or similar way. Many use similar copy-paste flow and facilitating it with a chat room would be great. Can we get this feature in sooner - as one of the first deliverables or make it reusable?

You nailed it—what you’ve been doing across docs and models is essentially a manual “multi‑AI seminar.” That signal (it keeps pulling you back) is a great product compass: lots of actuarial and research‑minded folks work exactly this way (copy‑paste across tools), so giving them a chat room that orchestrates several AIs with auditability is both desirable and on‑brand for ActCLI. Your whitepaper already points to LLM plugins and a CLI‑first workflow; this just pulls that thread forward as an early capability.

Below is a crisp plan to bring Multi‑AI Seminar forward as an early, reusable deliverable—without derailing the “trust‑first” spine from the docs.

Decision

Yes—ship Multi‑AI Seminar early. Make it a self‑contained module used by:

actcli chat (general seminar room), and

actcli reserve --wizard (guided workflows).
This aligns with your backlog’s LLM plugin system and Git/Gitea hooks, and your addendum’s governance/audit posture.

What “Multi‑AI Seminar” v1 does

Goal: One prompt in, parallel answers from several models out, with a concise, auditable synthesis and disagreement flags. (You called this out explicitly in the brainstorming doc, including hybrid cloud→local hand‑off; let’s formalize it.)

CLI
# One‑turn compare (fastest path)
actcli chat --multi llama3,claude,gpt \
  --prompt "Given this triangle, what assumptions should I test?" \
  --attach data/triangles_small.csv \
  --mode offline \
  --save out/seminar.md --audit out/seminar_audit.json

# Interactive room (REPL)
actcli chat --multi llama3,claude --room reserving --mode hybrid


--multi chooses models/roles.

--attach carefully exposes files through permissioned read (see governance).

--mode = offline (local only) or hybrid (cloud for ideation → auto‑switch local when sensitive data appears), as envisioned in your brainstorming notes. The handoff is logged in audit.

--save and --audit produce a transcript and evidence pack, reinforcing your trust layer.

Default seminar roles (reusable)

Conservative (risk‑averse baseline)

Challenger (aggressive/alternative view)

Quant (asks for/produces numeric checks)

Summarizer (concise synthesis + “what to test next”)

Roles are defined in a small seminar.toml so teams can reuse/share them.

# seminars/default.toml
[participants.conservative]
model = "llama3"         # local
style = "short,cautious"
permissions = ["read:./data", "no-network"]

[participants.challenger]
model = "claude"         # cloud; used only in hybrid before data attach
style = "challenging"

[participants.quant]
model = "llama3"         # local
style = "numeric,asks-clarifying"

[summary]
method = "local_llm"     # or "rule_based"

Trust, governance, and audit (baked‑in)

Your addendum stresses RBAC/audit/plugin certification; the seminar feature must inherit those guardrails, and the external critique says to keep LLMs assistive‑only. Concretely:

Permissioned file I/O: any --attach is mediated by a sandbox with an allow‑list (e.g., read:./data). No network for locals by default.

Hybrid hand‑off log: when sensitive files are attached in --mode hybrid, cloud models are disabled and the audit notes the switch (timestamp, models disabled/enabled, seed).

Assistive‑only: seminar can propose commands/snippets; execution requires explicit confirmation and is recorded as “LLM‑suggested; user‑approved” in the audit pack—same stance you’ve already endorsed.

Minimal architecture (thin slice, reusable)
actcli/
├─ seminar/
│  ├─ adapters/          # Model adapters (LocalOllama, OpenAI, Anthropic…)
│  ├─ coordinator.py     # Fan‑out/fan‑in, timeouts, retries
│  ├─ synthesizer.py     # Summary + disagreement detection
│  ├─ policy.py          # Offline/hybrid + permission checks
│  └─ transcript.py      # Markdown + audit JSON writers
└─ commands/chat.py      # CLI wrapper


Adapters: each implements generate(prompt, context, policy) -> text.

Coordinator: runs models in parallel; tags each response with model, tokens, latency.

Synthesizer:

v1: simple rule‑based synthesis + disagreement score (e.g., n‑gram overlap / Jaccard + keyword divergence).

v1.1: optional local summarizer model (small, offline) for a cleaner write‑up.

Policy (offline/hybrid): enforces cloud disconnect on sensitive attach; reflected in audit.

Transcript & audit: Markdown transcript plus seminar_audit.json with file hashes, seeds, model versions, prompts/response hashes, and any redactions—exactly the evidence style your addendum recommends.

This module is reusable by reserve --wizard later (the wizard just supplies a pre‑baked prompt template and injects the Chain‑Ladder results into the seminar as context). Your whitepaper’s Technical Overview/Backlog already anticipates the LLM plugin surface and Git hooks—this builds right on it.

What ships first (and why)

actcli chat --compare (single‑turn)
Parallel answers from N models, side‑by‑side, plus synthesized “Top agreements / disagreements” and a one‑paragraph “What to test next.” Saves transcript and audit pack. (This hits the immediate “copy‑paste across tools” pain you described.)

actcli chat --room (multi‑turn REPL)
Same as above, with short history. Add --attach for CSVs only in offline mode; hybrid must switch to offline and log it.

seminar.toml + actcli seminar verify
A governance command to lint role configs and permissions before running—mirrors your certification vibe.

These three keep the seminar feature useful, safe, and shareable—and they don’t block the core reserve chainladder demo you want for your killer MVP.

Output examples (what users get)

Transcript (Markdown)

Header with participants, models, mode (offline/hybrid), timestamp.

A section per model: response text.

Synthesis: 5 bullet summary; Disagreements with brief quotes; Next actions (e.g., “Run Mack SE with seeds 42/43”).

Audit JSON

{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "mode": "offline",
  "participants": [{"name":"conservative","model":"llama3","local":true}, ...],
  "attachments": [{"path":"data/triangles_small.csv","sha256":"..."}],
  "handoff": null,
  "prompts": [{"hash":"...", "redactions":["claim_id"]}],
  "responses": [{"model":"llama3","hash":"...","latency_ms":850}, ...],
  "disagreement_score": 0.32,
  "llm_role": "assistive_only"
}


Matches your evidence‑pack and audit‑trail ambitions.

How this fits your docs

Whitepaper: leverages the LLM plugin + CLI patterns and the “Development Backlog & Specifications” section (commands, Git hooks).

Additional Strategic Considerations: implements plugin governance, permissioned access, RBAC posture, and “Just Python scripts” adoption (seminar is an immediately useful helper).

External critique: honors “assistive‑not‑authoritative” and the Trojan‑horse adoption path (people come for the comfy chat, stay for deterministic runs).

Brainstorming doc: exactly the multi‑AI seminar + hybrid you proposed, made concrete.

Risks & mitigations (fast)

Noise/verbosity: cap responses or ask each role a slightly different job to be done (Conservative: list assumptions; Quant: ask 3 clarifying questions).

Latency/cost (cloud): show a token/time bar per model; offline defaults for attached data.

Hallucinations: synthesis highlights points of disagreement instead of forcing consensus; anything executable requires confirmation and lands in the audit.

TL;DR

You’re right: the “seminar” is how you—and many actuaries—already think. Bringing Multi‑AI Seminar forward as a first‑class feature is both feasible and on‑message for ActCLI. Make it a reusable module with offline/hybrid modes, permissioned file access, and audit packs. It becomes the friendly front door to the deterministic reserve and simulate commands—and a signature part of your product story.

If you want, I can turn the spec above into a seminar.toml starter + CLI stub you can drop into the repo right away.

Great screenshots—and your read is spot‑on: established CLIs are quiet and crisp, while newer ones add banners and onboarding. For ActCLI, I recommend a “quiet‑by‑default, secure‑by‑default, helpful‑on‑demand” startup that reinforces the pillars from your docs: trust/audit, offline/hybrid (local‑first), and the Multi‑AI Seminar as the friendly front door.

Below is a practical spec you can implement immediately.

Startup principles

Quiet by default (like git, docker).
A single concise header + hint. Details appear only when asked (--help, --wizard, or first‑run). This respects power users and scriptability.

Secure by default.

Detect “unsafe” contexts (home folder, non‑git dir) and warn, nudging actcli init.

Trust prompt before reading/writing files in a new folder (inspired by your screenshots).

Default offline; --mode hybrid allowed but clearly indicated and logged.

Helpful on demand.

A first‑run banner once per project: 3 feature bullets (Trust, Local/Hybrid, Multi‑AI Seminar) + two copy‑paste commands.

After that: a one‑line header and minimal tips.

What users should see
A) First run in a new project directory (actcli with no args)
ActCLI v0.1  •  mode: OFFLINE  •  project: ./claims-q3  •  audit: ENABLED

Why ActCLI (30s):
  • Trust & audit: every run produces an evidence pack (hashes, params, seed).
  • Local-first: data never leaves. Switchable hybrid mode for brainstorming.
  • Multi‑AI Seminar: compare models side‑by‑side, then confirm deterministic runs.

Quick start:
  $ actcli reserve chainladder -i data/triangles.csv \
      --report out/report.pdf --audit out/audit.json --seed 42
  $ actcli chat --multi llama3,claude --save out/seminar.md --audit out/seminar_audit.json

Tips:  actcli help   ·   actcli init   ·   actcli config --wizard


Rationale: echoes your whitepaper’s CLI‑first wedge and concrete reserving command, plus the addendum’s audit/controls and the “assistive‑not‑authoritative” stance for seminars.

B) Subsequent runs (same project, no args)
ActCLI v0.1 • mode: OFFLINE • repo: main@2a7f • last run: 2025‑09‑18 14:03 → out/report.pdf ✓
Top cmds: reserve • chat • plugin verify • doctor   |   help: actcli --help


Short, script‑friendly, and confidence‑building.

C) Safety guards (context‑aware)

Home directory / not a repo:

You’re running ActCLI in /home/alex (not a project directory).
Recommended: create a project folder and run `actcli init`.
Proceed anyway? [y/N]


Trust prompt (first file access in a new folder):

Do you trust files in this folder?  ./claims-q3
ActCLI may read/write/execute here. Use only with trusted sources.
  1) Yes, trust this folder   2) No, exit   3) Trust once
> 


Hybrid hand‑off (when data is attached):

Sensitive input detected: data/triangles.csv
Hybrid mode is now locked to LOCAL ONLY for this session. (Logged to audit.)


These map directly to your governance/audit posture and hybrid policy.

What to put in actcli --help (concise, discoverable)
Usage: actcli [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

Core commands
  reserve           Run reserving workflows (e.g., chainladder) → report + audit
  chat              Start a Multi‑AI Seminar (compare/summarize models, audited)
  plugin            Manage & verify plugins (manifests, permissions, signatures)
  config            View/set mode (offline/hybrid), defaults, telemetry
  init              Initialize project (creates actcli.toml, .gitignore entries)
  doctor            Check environment (local models, sandbox, git, PDF engine)

Common examples
  actcli reserve chainladder -i data/triangles.csv --report out/report.pdf --audit out/audit.json --seed 42
  actcli chat --multi llama3,claude --attach data/triangles.csv --save out/seminar.md --audit out/seminar_audit.json


Reserve and Chat are up front because they are your wedge and adoption magnet.

Plugin/config/doctor reflect your enterprise requirements (RBAC, audit, verification, environment checks).

Banner & visuals

Default: no ASCII art; a clean wordmark and a single line header.

Optional: ACTCLI_BANNER=on (or actcli config set banner on) for a tasteful 1‑line mark—no big block art.

Use subtle color and bold sparingly; keep output parse‑friendly for logs/CI.

Reserve tables and progress bars (via rich) for subcommands, not startup.

This keeps ActCLI feeling “established” from day one.

Config & persistence

Project file: actcli.toml (created by actcli init).

Global config: ~/.config/actcli/config.toml.

First‑run wizard writes: default mode = offline, telemetry = off (or minimal counts), PDF engine, repo linkage.

Trust list: ~/.config/actcli/trust.d/*.toml with path + fingerprint.

All mode switches and data attachments are recorded in the audit pack (your trust layer).

Reusing the startup patterns

The same concise header appears at the top of actcli chat and reserve runs, e.g.:
ActCLI • seminar • offline • participants: llama3,claude • audit: on.

After a successful run, print just the artifact paths:
✓ report: out/report.pdf ✓ audit: out/audit.json
This matches your “evidence‑pack” philosophy.

Why this design matches your docs

CLI‑first + deterministic core: reserves the spotlight for reserve and simulate while making seminars the assistive entry point.

Trust & governance: built‑in audit packs, permissioned file access, plugin verification, and explicit offline/hybrid state.

Adoption path: seminar is the comfortable front door (“Trojan horse”), but final computations are deterministic and reproducible—exactly what your external critique recommends.

Implementation notes (fast)

CLI: Typer/Click.

Formatting: rich for headers/tables; keep plain mode via --no-color.

Config: tomli-w/pydantic for actcli.toml.

Trust prompts: store decisions under trust.d; support --yes for CI.

Audit: write a compact JSON with hashes, versions, seed, mode, and “handoff” events. (You already scoped this in your plan.)

TL;DR

Startup: short header + 1‑line hint.

First‑run only: 3 bullets (Trust • Local/Hybrid • Seminar) + two copy‑paste commands.

Always: explicit mode, audit on, and clear safety prompts.

If you want, I can draft the exact rich header + actcli --help stub and a tiny actcli init wizard so you can paste into your repo and see the startup flow in under a minute.

Totally—“slash” commands are perfect for an ActCLI chat REPL and will also fix the “where am I?” problem (Claude vs Cursor vs Gemini) by giving you fast, muscle‑memory actions that show state (mode, models, audit) right above the prompt.

Below is a small, foundation set I’d ship first, plus a next set you can add in week 2. They align with your pillars: Trust/Audit, Local‑first + Hybrid, and Multi‑AI Seminar (assistive‑only).

Always‑visible status (to end the “which tool am I in?” confusion)

Show a one‑line header above the input every time the REPL waits:

ActCLI • chat(seminar) • MODE: OFFLINE • participants: llama3, claude • audit: ON


Changes instantly when you flip mode or participants.

On first data attach in hybrid, switch to LOCAL ONLY and log that handoff to the audit pack.

Tier‑0 (ship first): 14 slash commands

Scope: safe, deterministic, and enough to run a useful multi‑AI seminar with auditable outputs, consistent with “assistive‑only” AI + local/hybrid controls.

Session & safety

/help – Show commands and examples (short list; -a for all).

/mode [offline|hybrid] – Set or show mode. If a sensitive file is attached while in hybrid, auto‑lock to local and record the event in audit.

/audit [show|on|off-lite|save <path>] – Audit is on by default; allow “off‑lite” only to suppress verbose logs (never disable evidence pack for core runs).

/seed [N] – Set/show deterministic seed for any computations or simulations triggered from chat.

/trust [status|allow-once|allow-here|revoke] – Folder‑level trust prompt clone (like other CLIs). Writes decision to trust.d.

Files & privacy

/attach <path> – Attach a file with permissioned read; compute & display SHA‑256; add to audit. In hybrid, auto‑lock to local.

/scan – Run redaction/leak scan on current context; show what was masked.

/clear [files|history] – Drop attachments or chat history from the session (not from disk). Audit the action.

Multi‑AI seminar controls

/models [list|add <id>|remove <id>] – Manage backends (e.g., llama3, claude, gpt).

/focus <id1,id2,…> – Direct the next turn to a subset (e.g., focus only llama3).

/compare – Fan‑out one prompt to all active models and render side‑by‑side with a small disagreement summary; save to transcript. (Your “manual seminar” but one command.)

/summarize – Produce a local‑model synthesis (offline) with “agreements, disagreements, next checks.”

Deterministic actions (assistive‑only → confirmed run)

/reserve chainladder -i <file> [--report <pdf>] [--audit <json>] – Draft the command and show a dry‑run (no execution).

/approve – Execute the last drafted action; write report + audit + repro.sh. This enforces LLM‑assistive, deterministic execution.

Tier‑1 (week‑2 add‑ons)

/participants load <seminar.toml> – Load roles (Conservative/Challenger/Quant/Summarizer) from config.

/save [transcript.md] – Save the markdown transcript right now (also saved on exit).

/repro – Print path to the current session’s repro.sh (or generate if missing).

/plugin verify <actplugin.toml> – Lint permissions/signature before use.

/git commit -m "<msg>" – Commit report.pdf, audit.json, transcript; tags the commit with the audit ID. (Optional behind actcli config allow_git true).

Interaction examples

Compare across models, then run deterministically

> /mode hybrid
> /compare
Prompt: “Given this triangle, what assumptions should I test?”
…(cloud ideation allowed, no data yet)…

> /attach data/triangles_small.csv
Sensitive input detected → MODE: LOCAL ONLY (logged to audit)

> /compare
# side-by-side outputs + disagreement summary

> /reserve chainladder -i data/triangles_small.csv --report out/report.pdf --audit out/audit.json --seed 42
# shows DRY RUN: datasets, seed, output paths, hash

> /approve
✓ report: out/report.pdf   ✓ audit: out/audit.json   ✓ repro: out/repro.sh


This flow mirrors your docs: local‑first with optional hybrid brainstorming, audit evidence pack, and an assistive‑only LLM stance.

Why these first

Trust & audit are non‑negotiable in actuarial contexts; these commands bake them into the UX instead of burying them in config.

Local/hybrid is explicit so users always know where data flows—reinforced by status line and auto‑lock on attach.

Multi‑AI seminar is your adoption magnet; /compare, /summarize, /focus, /models give immediate value with minimal surface area.

Assistive → approved run (/reserve → /approve) honors the external critique: LLMs help, humans confirm, deterministic code executes.

Small UX touches (low effort, high clarity)

Header color & terminal title: Set the terminal title to ActCLI — OFFLINE — llama3,claude and use a subtle colored “MODE pill” in the header so you never wonder “which box am I in?”

Autocomplete & hints: Tab‑complete slash commands and model IDs; show contextual hints after /reserve (“press /approve to run”).

Plain‑text mode: --no-color and predictable output for logs/CI.

If you want, I can turn this into a chat_repl_spec.md and a tiny Click/Typer stub that implements /help, /mode, /attach, /compare, and /approve so you can feel the flow immediately.

---

## 0) External inspiration (OK to share)
For CLI patterns and structure, point devs to: `https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main`

---

## 1) Glossary / Scope

- **Tier‑0** (ship first): core chat REPL, status header, safety & trust, file attach with permissioning, multi‑model compare + local summarize, and the assistive→approved deterministic run bridge (`/reserve` → `/approve`).
- **Tier‑1** (week‑2 add‑ons): seminar role configs, transcript save, repro shortcut, plugin verify, optional git commit.
- **Modes**: `offline` (default) and `hybrid` (cloud allowed *until* sensitive attachments appear; then auto‑lock to local for the session).

Non‑goals here: long‑running multi‑agent “debates,” cloud secrets manager, or full RBAC (later milestone).

---

## 2) UX contract

### 2.1 Status line (always visible above prompt)


ActCLI • chat(seminar) • MODE: OFFLINE • participants: llama3, claude • audit: ON

Always show details
- Updates instantly when `/mode` or `/models` change.
- On first `/attach` in `hybrid`, switch to **LOCAL ONLY** for session and append a “handoff” event to the audit record.

### 2.2 First‑run hints (per project, once)
Show 3 bullets (Trust/Audit • Local/Hybrid • Seminar) and two copy‑pasteable commands; persist “seen” flag in project config.

### 2.3 Output philosophy
- Minimal by default; use `rich` for legible tables/headers; respect `--no-color` for CI.
- After successful deterministic runs, print artifacts only (paths to `report.pdf`, `audit.json`, `repro.sh`).

---

## 3) Commands and slash commands

### 3.1 CLI entry points
- `actcli chat [--multi <ids>] [--room <name>] [--mode offline|hybrid]`
- `actcli reserve chainladder -i <file> --report <pdf> --audit <json> [--seed N]` (exposed to chat via `/reserve`)

### 3.2 Slash commands (Tier‑0)
| Command | Syntax | Summary | Side Effects | Audit Event |

## 4) Reusable “Seminar” module



actcli/seminar/
adapters/ # Model adapters: OpenAI, Anthropic, LocalOllama, etc.
coordinator.py # Fan‑out/fan‑in; timeouts; retries; parallelism
synthesizer.py # Rule-based summarize + disagreement score
policy.py # Offline/Hybrid enforcement; trust gates; redaction
transcript.py # Markdown and audit.json writers

Always show details

### 4.1 Adapter interface
```python
class ModelAdapter(Protocol):
    name: str
    is_local: bool
    model_version: str
    def generate(self, prompt: str, *, system: str = "", seed: int | None = None, timeout_s: int = 30) -> str: ...

4.2 Coordinator contract

Inputs: prompt, adapters[], seed, focus_ids?, timeout_s.

Behavior: parallel calls with per‑adapter timeout; collect text, latency, token counts (if available).

Output: list of {name, is_local, version, text, latency_ms, token_usage?}.

4.3 Synthesis (v1 rule‑based, optional local LLM in v1.1)

Compute per‑pair Jaccard similarity on stemmed keywords; “disagreement score” = 1 ‑ mean(similarity).

Extract top 5 common points (agreements) and top 5 divergent statements.

Emit “Next checks” boilerplate (templated): e.g., “Run Mack SE with --seed N; inspect tail factors.”

4.4 Policy

offline → only is_local=True adapters allowed.

hybrid → cloud allowed until an /attach occurs; then lock to offline for the session (mode_lock_local event).

Redaction: apply allow‑list/regex to inputs before any non‑local adapter call; record masked fields in audit.

4.5 Transcript writer

Markdown layout: header (participants/mode/time), per‑model sections, synthesis block, and artifact links.

File paths default: out/seminar.md, out/seminar_audit.json (configurable via /audit save or --audit).

5) Config files

Always show details
{

    "audit_json": "out/audit.json",
    "repro_script": "out/repro.sh",
    "transcript_md": "out/seminar.md"
  }
}


Privacy note: store only hashes for prompts/responses by default; full text goes to the transcript file (which can be excluded from VCS by default).

7) Deterministic run bridge
7.1 Dry‑run command rendering

/reserve ... creates a “pending action”: render the exact command with resolved paths/seed, show expected outputs, and prompt to /approve.

No code or data runs until /approve.

7.2 Approve execution

On /approve, execute deterministic code path; capture env (Python & package versions) and write audit + repro.sh.

Return exit code 0 only if artifacts exist and hashes match expectations.

8) Safety & policy

Network: default deny for local adapters and plugins; allow only when explicit (--mode hybrid) and never after sensitive attachments.

Secrets: read via standard env vars (e.g., ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) but never write back to disk.

Telemetry: local only; counts of commands/runs/artifacts (no payload data).

9) Implementation notes

CLI: Typer (or Click).

Output: rich for headers/tables; --no-color fallback.

Adapters: abstract model backends now; add real providers incrementally (Ollama first).

Hashing: SHA‑256 via streaming for large files.

Concurrency: asyncio or concurrent.futures with per‑adapter timeouts.

Tests: ship golden dataset for chainladder; byte‑stable audit JSON under fixed seed.

Docs: docs/chat_repl_spec.md (this file) + examples folder.

10) Acceptance criteria

Tier‑0 DoD

Status header reflects mode/participants; /mode and /models work.

/attach switches hybrid→local and logs mode_lock_local.

/compare renders side‑by‑side responses; /summarize emits offline synthesis.

/reserve shows dry‑run; /approve writes artifacts and audit + repro.sh.

Two identical runs with --seed 42 produce identical numeric results and stable audit fields.

Tier‑1 DoD

seminar.toml loads; /participants load applies roles.

/plugin verify rejects bad permissions and accepts a signed minimal manifest.

/save, /repro, /git commit work; commit tagged with audit ID (when enabled).

11) Open questions (track in GitHub issues)

What constitutes “sensitive” to trigger hybrid→local? (initial: any file attachment under project root).

Minimum local model spec to bundle or auto‑pull (e.g., llama3:8b)?

Default redaction rules (claim IDs, policy numbers, names).

body = """
## 0) External inspiration (OK to share)
For CLI patterns and structure, point devs to: `https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main`

---

## 1) Glossary / Scope

- **Tier‑0** (ship first): core chat REPL, status header, safety & trust, file attach with permissioning, multi‑model compare + local summarize, and the assistive→approved deterministic run bridge (`/reserve` → `/approve`).
- **Tier‑1** (week‑2 add‑ons): seminar role configs, transcript save, repro shortcut, plugin verify, optional git commit.
- **Modes**: `offline` (default) and `hybrid` (cloud allowed *until* sensitive attachments appear; then auto‑lock to local for the session).

Non‑goals here: long‑running multi‑agent “debates,” cloud secrets manager, or full RBAC (later milestone).

---

## 2) UX contract

### 2.1 Status line (always visible above prompt)


ActCLI • chat(seminar) • MODE: OFFLINE • participants: llama3, claude • audit: ON

Always show details
- Updates instantly when `/mode` or `/models` change.
- On first `/attach` in `hybrid`, switch to **LOCAL ONLY** for session and append a “handoff” event to the audit record.

### 2.2 First‑run hints (per project, once)
Show 3 bullets (Trust/Audit • Local/Hybrid • Seminar) and two copy‑pasteable commands; persist “seen” flag in project config.

### 2.3 Output philosophy
- Minimal by default; use `rich` for legible tables/headers; respect `--no-color` for CI.
- After successful deterministic runs, print artifacts only (paths to `report.pdf`, `audit.json`, `repro.sh`).

---

## 3) Commands and slash commands

### 3.1 CLI entry points
- `actcli chat [--multi <ids>] [--room <name>] [--mode offline|hybrid]`
- `actcli reserve chainladder -i <file> --report <pdf> --audit <json> [--seed N]` (exposed to chat via `/reserve`)

### 3.2 Slash commands (Tier‑0)

Yes—share the Tier‑0/Tier‑1 plan with devs and include the spec‑kit pointer. To make hand‑off easy, I’ve packaged a developer‑ready spec you can download and drop into the repo:

ActCLI — Tier‑0 & Tier‑1 Specs (chat REPL + Multi‑AI Seminar)
Download the Markdown

It captures the slash‑command contract, offline/hybrid policy, audit JSON schema, seminar.toml, trust store layout, adapter interface, synthesis logic, acceptance criteria, and example headers/output.

A few quick notes you can paste into the hand‑off email:

Why these features first? They map directly to your whitepaper’s CLI‑first wedge and MVP backlog (reserve/report/audit) while elevating the Multi‑AI seminar as the “friendly front door.”

Governance & trust baked‑in. The spec operationalizes your additional‑considerations doc (permissioned file access, audit packs, plugin verification, Git/Gitea hooks) so it’s enterprise‑acceptable from day one.

Assistive → approved run. LLMs propose; humans approve; deterministic code executes—echoing the external critique’s “assistive‑not‑authoritative” guidance.

Spec‑kit pointer (good idea): this aligns with the “Microsoft heritage” credibility theme already in your docs—include this link for CLI structure inspiration:
https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main.

What’s inside the spec (highlights)

Tier‑0 (ship first):
/help, /mode, /audit, /seed, /trust, /attach, /scan, /clear, /models, /focus, /compare, /summarize, /reserve (dry‑run), /approve (execute deterministically).
Seminar module with adapter interface, coordinator (fan‑out/timeout), rule‑based synthesis + disagreement score, transcript writer, and offline/hybrid policy with auto‑lock to local on sensitive attachments.

Tier‑1 (week‑2 add‑ons):
/participants load <seminar.toml>, /save, /repro, /plugin verify <actplugin.toml>, /git commit -m "<msg>" (guarded).
Config files for actcli.toml, seminar.toml, actplugin.toml, and trust.d/….

Audit JSON schema (v0): session metadata, participants (local/cloud), attachments + SHA‑256, mode/handoff events, prompt/response hashes, disagreement score, and artifact paths—matching your evidence‑pack vision.

Acceptance criteria: byte‑stable audits under fixed seed; hybrid→local lock on /attach; side‑by‑side compare + offline summarize; dry‑run then approve to execute; seminar.toml load; plugin verify.

If you want, I can also spin this into a minimal Click/Typer stub for actcli chat implementing /mode, /attach, /compare, and /approve so the team can run the flow immediately.
