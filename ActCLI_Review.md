# ActCLI — Decision‑Oriented Review & Next Steps
**Last updated:** 2025-09-18

## What was reviewed
- **ActCLI whitepaper** (PDF, 6 pages).
- **Additional Strategic Considerations** (Markdown).
- **External critique/summary** (Markdown).

This review condenses the key strengths, risks, and a concrete 12‑week plan to validate the concept with real users and enterprises.

## Executive verdict

**Proceed** with a tightly scoped MVP aimed at developer‑leaning **P&C reserving/pricing actuaries**. The wedge: a **CLI‑first, on‑prem AI‑assist** that ships **auditability and reproducibility as product features**.

- **Market need:** High. Actuaries need automation, evidence packs, and privacy‑preserving AI—current GUI tools don’t deliver this combination.
- **Differentiation:** CLI‑centric design, **local LLM plugins**, open‑source extensibility, and a niche focus on actuarial workflows.
- **Feasibility:** Strong. Python + Click/Typer, LangChain (or equivalent) for orchestration, and Git‑based flows are low risk for an MVP.
- **Enterprise fit:** Promising. RBAC, audit trails, AD/LDAP, plugin certification, and data‑residency controls are already considered.

**Bottom line:** There’s real value and future potential. Make **trust** and **reproducibility** first‑class and demonstrate one irresistible end‑to‑end use case.

---

## Strengths to keep (highlights)

1. **Crisp value prop.** “Terminal‑native actuarial workflows with on‑prem LLM assistance.”
2. **Trust & control.** Emphasis on local models and permissioned tool access; no sensitive data leaves the environment.
3. **Monetization options.** Open‑core + paid plugins + enterprise support + optional hosted components.
4. **Enterprise readiness roadmap.** RBAC, audit trails, certification for plugins, version pinning, and deprecation policies.

## Gaps to close (prioritized)

### 1) Productize trust (make audits a feature)
Ship a minimal **Trust Layer** in v1:
- Dataset & code hashing (content‑addressable inputs).
- Deterministic runs via global **--seed** and environment capture.
- Parameter & version ledger (who/what/when).
- Auto‑generated **evidence pack** (inputs, methods, versions, assumptions, and a one‑click repro script).

### 2) Narrow the wedge use case
Pick one 10× demo and perfect it end‑to‑end. Recommended:

```bash
actcli reserve chainladder -i triangles.csv   --report out/ifrs17_reserving.pdf   --audit out/audit.json   --seed 42 --repro-script out/repro.sh
```

This turns a CSV into a PDF report **plus** a complete audit bundle.

### 3) Constrain the LLM’s role in v1
LLMs should be **assistive, not authoritative**: generate starter code, docs, and parameter suggestions; then execute **validated, deterministic** computations only.

### 4) Plugin governance — ship a process, not just a policy
Introduce a signed **Plugin Manifest** (e.g., `actplugin.toml`) declaring permissions and versions. Provide:
- `actcli plugin init/install/verify/list`
- Sandbox execution & permission prompts (files, network, MCP tools)
- Semantic versioning and a certification badge

**Example (illustrative):**
```toml
name = "ifrs17_disclosure_pack"
version = "0.1.0"
entrypoint = "plugins/ifrs17/main.py"
permissions = ["read:./data", "write:./out", "no-network"]
requires = ["numpy>=1.26", "pandas>=2.0"]
signature = "SIG_ED25519_BASE64..."
```

### 5) Interoperate with incumbent stacks early
Even in MVP:
- **Inbound:** CSV/Excel and one database connector (e.g., Postgres or S3).
- **Outbound:** PDF report + Excel/CSV export to slot into existing review/reporting flows.

### 6) License strategy
Use **permissive open‑source for core**, with **commercial licensing** for enterprise controls (RBAC/AD/LDAP, policy enforcement, certified connectors).

## Product framing

- **Primary persona:** Quant‑leaning **P&C reserving/pricing actuary** already using Python/Git.
- **Beachhead workflow:** Quarterly reserving cycle and **rate‑filing exhibits** requiring speed and defensibility.
- **Job‑to‑be‑done:** “From the latest loss triangles, produce a compliant reserving report with a full audit trail in under an hour.”

---

## MVP plan (12 weeks)

**Weeks 1–2 — Core & Trust Layer**
- CLI skeleton (Click/Typer), config, local telemetry (privacy‑safe).
- Dataset/code hashing, `--seed`, audit ledger JSON, repro script export.

**Weeks 3–4 — Reserving command (killer demo)**
- `actcli reserve chainladder` with unit tests and golden datasets.
- PDF/Excel export + narrative report generator.

**Weeks 5–6 — Monte Carlo “sim” (minimal but parallelized)**
- `actcli mc simulate` (10–50k runs), progress meter, resuming, seeded runs.

**Weeks 7–8 — Plugin system (permissions)**
- Manifest, sandbox, signing & `plugin verify`. Example plugin: **IFRS‑17 disclosure pack**.

**Weeks 9–10 — Git/Gitea integration**
- `--host` flag; GitOps hooks to auto‑commit outputs and evidence packs.

**Weeks 11–12 — Pilot hardening**
- Local RBAC, AD/LDAP spike, docs, sample datasets, demo script/video.

---

## Go‑to‑market

- **Bottom‑up adoption:** Publish as “automation helpers,” not a platform. Provide a 1‑file quickstart and copy‑paste recipes.
- **Design partners:** 3–5 actuarial teams; measure *time‑to‑analysis* and *audit‑prep time* reductions.
- **Content:** “ActCLI Cookbook” — 20 short recipes (triangle import, Mack method, scenario runs, report templates).

---

## Business model notes

- **Open core:** reserving/simulate commands and basic exports (free).
- **Paid:** enterprise auth (AD/LDAP), certified plugins, policy enforcement, audit‑pack templates, official connectors (AXIS/Prophet/ResQ, Tableau/Power BI).

---

## Document‑level suggestions (redlines)

- Sharpen the competitive claim; explain why **CLI beats GUI** for auditability, automation, CI/CD.
- Move detailed naming/trademark content to an appendix; keep a short naming principle in the main doc.
- Convert the backlog into a **90‑day plan** with explicit deliverables and pilot criteria.
- Acknowledge LLM limits and state the **assistive‑only** v1 policy explicitly.

---

## Final take

**CLI‑first + on‑prem LLMs + reproducible actuarial workflows** is a differentiated, executable wedge with real enterprise appetite. **Productize trust** and **nail one irresistible demo**, and you’ll have something power users love and risk officers accept.
